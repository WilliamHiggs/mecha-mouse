# Mecha-Mouse :mouse:
## A game made in Löve and Lua for Itch.io Game Off 2018

My personal challenge was to learn Lua, learn the Löve framework and learn enough game development to build a fully functional game in 30 days.
The theme was 'hybrid' I interpreted this theme by mixing real world photos with pixel art and having a mouse/machine hybrid creature.

### Setup
You will need Löve to run these files directly. And then clone this directory and add its submodules.
The game is available online at my Itch.io account https://williamhiggs.itch.io/mecha-mouse
### Challenge
This is the first game I have ever built. I made a lot of mistakes very early on but I felt more confident with it every day.
Lua is a very nice language to work with, it was a quick learning curve and Löve has tons of documentation online.
I've learnt how to draw and animate sprites, collision detection, delta-times, basic game physics and much more.
