# Mecha-Mouse :mouse:
## A game made in Löve and Lua for Itch.io Game Off 2018

My personal challenge was to learn Lua, learn the Löve framework and learn enough game development to build a fully functional game in 30 days.
The theme was 'hybrid' I interpreted this theme by mixing real world photos with pixel art and having a mouse/machine hybrid creature.

### Setup
You will need Löve to run these files directly. And then clone this directory and add its submodules.
The game will be available online at my Itch.io account and ported to HTML5 and Javascript using https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/love.js
### Challenge
This is the first game I have ever built. I made a lot of mistakes very early on but I felt more confident with it every day.
Lua is a very nice language to work with, it was a quick learning curve and Löve has tons of documentation online.
I've learnt how to draw and animate sprites, collision detection, delta-times, basic game physics and much more.
